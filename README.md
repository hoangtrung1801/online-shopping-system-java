## Introduction

This is my project for my final test in university (subject: OOP). 

## Requirement
- Javafx v17.0.1
- JDBC

## Getting Started

Step 1 : Add libary Javafx and JDBC into folder lib
Step 2 : Turn on database and run all files *.sql in folder src/database
Step 3 : Run file App.java

## Folder Structure

The workspace contains two folders by default, where:

- `src`: the folder to maintain sources
- `lib`: the folder to maintain dependencies

Meanwhile, the compiled output files will be generated in the `bin` folder by default.

> If you want to customize the folder structure, open `.vscode/settings.json` and update the related settings there.

## Dependency Management

The `JAVA PROJECTS` view allows you to manage your dependencies. More details can be found [here](https://github.com/microsoft/vscode-java-dependency#manage-dependencies).
